Smart Supply Chain Dashboard

This project simulates real-world supply chain decision-making using Excel modeling and Power BI-style visualization concepts. It focuses on inventory metrics, supplier evaluation, and strategic trade-offs between Just-in-Time (JIT) and buffer stock strategies.

1. Project Overview

Goal: Build a data-driven dashboard that helps managers optimize inventory levels, evaluate supplier risks, and compare stocking strategies to inform commercial decisions.

Tools Used:

Microsoft Excel (Advanced Formulas)

PDF Summary Report

2. Core Components

📦 Inventory Metrics (10 Products)

Calculated:

EOQ (Economic Order Quantity)

ROP (Reorder Point)

Safety Stock

Average Inventory

Inventory Turnover

DIO (Days Inventory Outstanding)

Classified with ABC analysis:

A = High value, low volume

B = Moderate value/volume

C = Low value, high volume

🧮 Supplier Risk Evaluation

Suppliers: A to E

Ratings:

Cost, Lead Time, Quality (1–10 scale)

Weighted Scoring:

40% Cost, 30% Lead Time, 30% Quality

Output:

Supplier D = Best score (7.9), Supplier E = Lowest (5.6)

Risk-based segmentation and visual comparison

⚖️ JIT vs Buffer Stock Strategy

Parameters compared:

Holding Cost

Stockout Risk

Ordering Cost

Total Cost

Risk Score (1–10)

Outcome:

JIT: Leaner but riskier (Total Cost = €3000, Risk = 8)

Buffer: Safer but costlier (Total Cost = €4500, Risk = 3)

📊 Summary Visuals (included in PDF):

Inventory KPIs

ABC Category Distribution

Supplier Score Comparison

Strategy Comparison (Cost & Risk)

3. Key Insights

Class A items contribute ~48% of inventory value with fewer SKUs.

Supplier D offers the best risk-adjusted reliability.

Buffer strategy reduces risk but adds €1500 in annual cost.

EOQ optimization and supplier segmentation improve both efficiency and resilience.
